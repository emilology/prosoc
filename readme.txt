Dev logs:

30 September 15
Changed the header section so it makes sense & is the same across the site.
Unsuccessfully tried to edit the image so you can see the green door on mobile
 - still can't seem to get that working.
Deleted some random files we don't need


Tried to make a universal header. Looking like SSIs should work -
 can't test on python server but can test it if I try get it on the real site
 if not, look for a template
 would be great to have a template anyway - it would be much easier to edit.
